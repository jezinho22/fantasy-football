# fantasy-football
I have done a fantasy football competition for world cups and for euros since 1998, I think. England played Tunisia during the afternoon and we all had to think up ways to make it OK to watch in school. Partly because families would have just not brought the children in that day.  
The aim of the fantasy football was to make use of some place value - millions - and some calculations including negative numbers - and to raise some money.  
It was not long before I decided to use a spreadsheet, and by 2010 I was posting the updated table on a blogger page and I had over a hundred entries. It went downhill a bit after that because I was head of a much smaller school - so more busy with fewer people to take part. I really wanted to automate it more - integrate some web pages to update scores etc automatically. It's hard because teams were submitted very late in 2022, plus I no longer worked in a school and fantasy football has kind of run its course unless you're a child or a parent.  
I did it anyway - this time having to learn Power Automate to make it work, because VBA was no longer well supported but I didn't want to lose all my previous Excel work. Unfortunately by the time I had done it, we were halfway through the world cup. So it is largely untested and unused.
